It's a simple project that describes how to make a simple confirmation page using bootstrap 4 also how to use bootstap documantation 
for making this type of resposive page.

# How to See the Project Page

At first clone the repository or download the file and then just simply open the `index.html` file.

There is Two button one is Yes and another is No. I just use html ancor tag which <a> which navigate one page to another. So when a user click 
to the No button its navigate to him `Warrning.html` file.

# How I make this page

As per as I already said I used the bootstarp4 framework for this project. So at first I open the documentation website of bootstrap
then I click to the getting started button after that I copy the template code for the inital library calling of bootstrap. where bootstrap
css, js  are mentioned as a CDN link. CDN means the (Content Delivery Network).

So when I implemented the copied code it looks like this :

After that I use a component called `Jumbotron` which is a bootstrap component. This component gives a box size interface where
we can set paragaraph, button, bar, input field etc. why we use that jumbotron because its a resposive box component, its besically adjust the 
handle screen ratio size for different devices.

Now into this jumbotron `div` box I used a image html tag `<img>` where I saw the warrning image. A header5,`<h5>` html tag
where it shows the warrning message and paragarap tag `<p>` where I describe what will happed after click those two buttons.
For showing those two YES and NO button I used another div box where that div class defined as `d-flex justify-content-center`
which will make those button into the center of the page.

Same class I called for those image, header and paragraph also so that content should see into the middle side of the page

Here is the code screen shot for the work:
